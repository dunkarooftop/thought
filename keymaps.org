I would like to share my custom keyboard setup with the coummunity. Here is
a little background. I am a hobbist programmer/tinker and been
building customize keyboard and developing my own keymaps for a long
time. Looking for a Haskell development is what lead me to the
*wonderful Emacs world*. My Emacs setup is mostly base on the idea of
=evil= and =leader=. I don't really use much of the =modifier= keys, but my
keymap is actually really good for someone who use default Emacs
binding.

What get me started on the jounery of custom keyboard is =Plank
keyboard=. Combing with [[https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard][=TMK firmware=]] or [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware][=QMK firmware=]] (QMK is a
fork of TMK which is what I use.) you have endless possibliity. The
day I realize I can build my own keyboard layout was golrious! Plank
get all my creative juice flowing but I am not a fan of Cherry switch.
Luckly there is a custom controller for my daily driver HHKB (Topre
switch, I will leave the key switch talk out of this post. It's a huge
topic.) I then remove my HHKB spacebar row and push everything up 1
row and made the *Spaceless keymap*.

** Some of the highlight from those 2 firmware:

- Dual role key (single key can have dual action base on tap/hold)
- Leader key (this baby is system wide)
- Up to 32 layers (layers are like Emacs =minor-mod-map=)
- Tap dance (different action base on single/double/triple taps)
- Able to bake in macro
- Live record macro and play back
- Simultaneous Key Presses
- Mouse key movement
- MIDI controler (like a piano)
- If you know =C/C++= then anything is possible.

Whith those building blocks I set out to developing my own keymap.
(For Vim user, you can actually program basic Vim movement layer
available system-wide)

- No. 1 goal is *CONFORT*
- pinkey lateral movement is the worst! Avoid it at all cost.
- Thumbs are the strongest fingers, make the most use of it.

My default letter entering keyboard layout is [[https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/]["Colemak-HD"]] which I found
super confortable to type. All the top  N(2)-gram words are on the home
row. Your fingers don't move up and down much. Here are my keymaps!

** Normal 

|-------+---+---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+-------+-------|
|-------+---+---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+-------+-------|
|       | q | w | f     | p     | b     | j     | l     | u     | y |       |       |
|-------+---+---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+-------+-------|
| *<0>* | a | r | s     | *t*   | g     | m     | *n*   | e     | i | o     | *<1>* |
|-------+---+---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+-------+-------|
| *<2>* | z | x | c     | d     | v     | k     | h     | '     | " | *<3>* |       |
|-------+---+---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+-------+-------|
|       |   |   | *<4>* | *<5>* | *<6>* | *<7>* | *<8>* | *<9>* |   |       |       |
|-------+---+---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---+-------+-------|
The homerow bump key is in bold.


- *<0>* TAP: `(`         HOLD: `CMD`
- *<1>* TAP: `<leader>`
- *<2>* TAP: `<escape>`  HOLD: `<CMD+ALT+SHIFT>`
- *<3>* TAP: `<return>`  HOLD: `<CMD+CTRL+SHIFT>
- *<4>* TAP: `_`         HOLD: `ALT`
- *<5>* TAP: `<delete>`  HOLD: `enter NUMBER-MAP`  with *<8>* `backward-delete`
- *<6>* TAP: `M-x`       HOLD: `SHIFT`
- *<7>* TAP: `.`         HOLD: `SHIFT`             with *<5>* `,`
- *<8>* TAP: `<space>`   HOLD: `enter SYMBOL-MAP`  with *<5>* `<TAB>`
- *<9>* TAP:  `=`        HOLD: `CTRL`

- =SHIFT=, =ALT=, and =CTRL= are all trigger by THUMBS easily.

- SHIFT are both in the middle. Compare to the old position which pin
  one of your pinky plus pinky lateral movement. It made typing CAPS
  WORDS super easy. With SHIFT in the middle I can get away with just
  one of them really.

- I use dual-role key on all my =modifier=.

- In normal map I lifted `'` and `"` to their own keys. (instead of
  tridictional on top of each other.)

- *1* It's a system-wide leader key, I use mostly for window
  management, switch apps and simple snippits.

- *2* and *3* those crazy 3 modifiers combo are convenient modifier key for
  not shadowing any default keys. One key press I get 3 modifiers :)

- `M-x` is the latest addition to the keymap!! I actually use double
  tap `<space>` to trigger `counsel-MX` but can't help to throw it in
  there to show my love for Emacs.

- top right key which is not showing in this map is =search current
  selected word in Google= Definelly one of my favorite key. :)

** Symbol map

|---+---+---+---+-----+---+---+-----+---+-------+---+---|
|---+---+---+---+-----+---+---+-----+---+-------+---+---|
|   |   | ~ | ( | )   |   |   | [   | ] | ;     |   |   |
|---+---+---+---+-----+---+---+-----+---+-------+---+---|
|   | / | - | - | *+* | $ | % | *@* | ! | \vert | \ |   |
|---+---+---+---+-----+---+---+-----+---+-------+---+---|
|   | ` | ^ | { | }   | & | ? | <   | > | #     | : |   |
|---+---+---+---+-----+---+---+-----+---+-------+---+---|
|   |   |   |   |     |   |   | *X* |   |       |   |   |
|---+---+---+---+-----+---+---+-----+---+-------+---+---|

- *X* mark it thumb pressed down to enable this map.

** Number map

|---+------+------+------+---------+-----+---+-----+---+---+---+---|
|---+------+------+------+---------+-----+---+-----+---+---+---+---|
|   |      | PgUp | Up   | PgDw    |     |   |   1 | 2 | 3 |   |   |
|---+------+------+------+---------+-----+---+-----+---+---+---+---|
|   | HOME | Left | DOWN | *Right* | END | . | *4* | 5 | 6 | 0 |   |
|---+------+------+------+---------+-----+---+-----+---+---+---+---|
|   | RET  | MRC  | TAB  | Space   |     |   |   7 | 8 | 9 |   |   |
|---+------+------+------+---------+-----+---+-----+---+---+---+---|
|   |      |      |      | *X*     |     |   |     |   |   |   |   |
|---+------+------+------+---------+-----+---+-----+---+---+---+---|

- *X* mark it thumb pressed down to enable this map.
- MRC is right mouse bottom.
- My right hand is holding a stylus when I am doing graphic design
  stuff. So I made my left hand being able to trigger some of the most
  common keys as well like =RET=, =RIGHT MOUSE CLICK=, =TAB= and
  =SPACE=.

There are some more maps but it's mostly personal workflow I will just
leave it out. The point of this post is about the idea not super fine
grain detials.

One things Emacs made me realize the beauty of having =normal=,
=symbol= and =number= maps lay on top of each other is each key
position has 3 mnemonics meaning to me. For example the key that house
=h=, =<=, =7= has 3 meaning which is super helpful to cerate mnemonics
hotkeys. It could mean =Help=, =<= (directional, indent or
grow/shrink) and =7= when combine with other modifier.

Here is an example I could assign

|------------------+--------------------+---------------+---------------|
| modifier key     | grouping           | single key    | meaning       |
|                  |                    | think as      |               |
|                  |                    |               |               |
|------------------+--------------------+---------------+---------------|
| <CMD+ALT+SHIFT>  | <= ivy related     | "<"           | shrink buffer |
|                  |                    | (scale)       |               |
|------------------+--------------------+---------------+---------------|
| <CMD+CTRL+SHIFT> | <= Paredit related | "<"           | slurping      |
|                  |                    | (directional) |               |
|------------------+--------------------+---------------+---------------|
| <CTRL>           | <= Emacs           | "h"           | C-h           |
|                  |                    | (help)        |               |
|------------------+--------------------+---------------+---------------|

In the 3rd column are all the same physical key.
When I wanna trigger `ivy-minibuffer-shrink` it is actually assign to
`<CMD+ALT+SHIFT> + h` (It's only 2 key press not 4) but in my head I
think that key as `<` not `h`.

Another quick example would be like

|------------------+--------------------+-------------+--------------------|
| modifier key     | grouping           | single key  | meaning            |
|                  |                    | think as    |                    |
|                  |                    |             |                    |
|------------------+--------------------+-------------+--------------------|
| <CMD+ALT+SHIFT>  | <= ivy related     | "!"         | ivy-immediate-done |
|                  |                    | (immediate) |                    |
|------------------+--------------------+-------------+--------------------|
| <CMD+CTRL+SHIFT> | <= Paredit related | "e"         | barfing            |
|                  |                    | (Extend)    |                    |
|------------------+--------------------+-------------+--------------------|

(without Org-mode table I don't know how would I write this post!)

** Keyboard that I would recommend people who is interested in *spaceless keymap*

All of the fallowing keyboard are programable and have small spacebar.

- HHKB (Topre switch) with hasu's controller
  [[https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=12047.0][hasu's controller]]
  He is also the creater of `TMK-firmware` SUPER awesome guy!

- HHKB Japanese version (Topre)
  If you don't want to remove the bottom row. Their spacebar is way
  smaller.
